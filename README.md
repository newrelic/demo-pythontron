# demo-pythontron

![Test](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-pythontron/workflows/Test/badge.svg?event=push)

`demo-pythontron` is a REST application written in Python using the Flask framework. 

It can be installed on a host or an AWS lambda function, and deployed with the [demo-deployer](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer).


## Behaviors

Pythontron supports the below behaviors.
For more information, see the [Behavior Documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer/tree/main/documentation/developer/behaviors)

* Throw
* Compute
* Memory Allocation


## Requirement

* Python 3.7

When hosting on a physical host or VM (not serverless/lambda), pythontron requires at least 800MB of memory.
When deployed with the deployer, a `memmon` watchdog process ensures the process is recycled if the memory consumption exceed this threshold.


## Configuration

Each Pythontron you deploy will have its own configuration.  In the example below, you can see that app1 (this configuration) will talk to app2 and app3.  When app1/api/inventory is visited, the inventory returned will be from app2.  When app1/api/inventory/3 is visited, the inventory item returned will be from app3.  The dependencies tell Pythontron where to find app2 and app3. App2 and app3 will each have their own configurations, and so on.

```json
{
  "id": "app1",
  "port": 5000,
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "id":"app2",
      "urls":["http://localhost:5001"]
    },
    {
      "id":"app3",
      "urls":["http://localhost:5002"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Deploy with the `demo-deployer`
This python application can be deployed with the [demo-deployer](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer) using the /deploy scripts in this repository.
Here is an example of the deploy config that can be used to deploy a pythontron service on an AWS/EC2 instance:

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "python1",
      "source_repository": "https://github.com/newrelic/demo-pythontron.git",
      "deploy_script_path": "deploy/linux/roles",
      "port": 5001,
      "destinations": ["host"],
      "params": {
        "delay_start_ms": 5000
      }
    }
  ],

  "resources": [
    {
      "id": "host",
      "provider": "aws",
      "type": "ec2",
      "size": "t2.micro"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Params
* delay_start_ms can be used to delay the time the service starts by this amount in milliseconds. During that interval, any incoming http request will error.

#### Serverless deployment
`demo-pythontron` can also be deployed on AWS/Lambda using the [demo-deployer](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer).
Here is an example of deploy config

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "python1",
      "source_repository": "https://github.com/newrelic/demo-pythontron.git",
      "deploy_script_path": "deploy/lambda/roles",
      "destinations": ["lambdahost"]
    }
  ],
  "resources": [
    {
      "id": "lambdahost",
      "provider": "aws",
      "type": "lambda"
    }
  ]
}
```


### API endpoints and purposes

| Endpoint               | Purpose                                                                         |
| -----------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /api/inventory             | Fetch a JSON list of inventory items          |
| /api/inventory/{item_id}   | Fetch a single JSON inventory item by its id      |
| /api/validateMessage?message=<message>  | Returns true for validation of message |
| /api/help                  | Return api usage       |


## Setup and Installation of Pythontron

To ensure you're picking up the right version of Python in your local environment, always specify version 3 when running commands.

Switch into the `python` folder and run the following commands from there.

### Dependencies

```
python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt -r linux-requirements.txt --user
```

### Start the Application

```shell
python3 tron.py -c config/app_config.json.local
```

**To validate, visit:**

* localhost:5000
* localhost:5000/api/inventory
* localhost:5000/api/inventory/3
* localhost:5000/api/validateMessage

### To execute unit tests:

From within the `python` folder:

```python3 -m unittest discover -v```

### To list available APIs:

```http://{host}:{port}/api/help```


### Cron jobs support

Cron jobs can be registered upon deployment using the demo-deployer Files configuration for the service. Here is an example for restarting a `python1` service every hour, at the 0 minute.

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "python1",
      "display_name": "Python1",
      "source_repository": "https://github.com/newrelic/demo-pythontron.git",
      "deploy_script_path": "deploy/linux/roles",
      "port": 5001,
      "destinations": ["host"],
      "files": [
        {
          "destination_filepath": "python/cronjob.json",
          "content": [
              {
                  "frequency": "0 * * * *",
                  "job": "/usr/bin/supervisorctl restart python1",
                  "root": true
              }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
